### Assets

#### Overview of Changes
Sylius has modernized its asset management system with these key improvements:
- Bundle-prefixed controller paths
- JSON-based configuration
- Flexible controller registration options

#### Updated Controller Paths
All core controllers now use standardized bundle prefixes:

**Admin Controllers**  

| Old Path                         | New Path                                              |
|----------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|
| `slug`                           | `@sylius/admin-bundle/slug`                           |
| `taxon-slug`                     | `@sylius/admin-bundle/taxon-slug`                     |
| `taxon-tree`                     | `@sylius/admin-bundle/taxon-tree`                     |
| `delete-taxon`                   | `@sylius/admin-bundle/delete-taxon`                   |
| `product-attribute-autocomplete` | `@sylius/admin-bundle/product-attribute-autocomplete` |
| `product-taxon-tree`             | `@sylius/admin-bundle/product-taxon-tree`             |
| `save-positions`                 | `@sylius/admin-bundle/save-positions`                 |
| `compound-form-errors`           | `@sylius/admin-bundle/compound-form-errors`           |
| `tabs-errors`                    | `@sylius/admin-bundle/tabs-errors`                    |

**Shop Controller**  
`api-login` → `@sylius/shop-bundle/api-login`

#### New Configuration System

**Configuration Files**
```text
assets/
  admin/
    controllers.json  # Admin controller configurations
  shop/
    controllers.json  # Shop controller configurations
  controllers.json # Shared controllers configurations imported via flex
```

**Example Configuration**:
```json
{
  "@sylius/admin-bundle/slug": {
    "enabled": true,
    "fetch": "lazy"
  }
}
```

**Key Actions**:
- Enable/disable controllers
- Change loading behavior (lazy/eager)
- Extend with custom controllers

#### Controller Registration Methods

1. **Automatic Discovery**
    - Files in `./controllers/` directory
    - Naming pattern: `[name]_controller.js`
    - Auto-registered with Stimulus

2. **JSON Configuration**
    - Pre-configured bundle controllers
    - Managed via `controllers.json` files
    - Lazy-loaded by default

3. **Manual Registration**
   ```javascript
   // In bootstrap.js:
   import CustomController from './custom_controller_dir/custom_controller';
   app.register('custom', CustomController);
   ```
   Use for:
    - Third-party controllers
    - Non-standard locations
    - Advanced initialization

#### Migration Guide
1. Update all controller references to use new prefixed paths
2. Review [Sylius-Standard PR #1126](https://github.com/Sylius/Sylius-Standard/pull/1126) for implementation details

**Note**: The old mechanism will remain functional until you actively migrate to the new system.
